Learning Management System (LMS) Architecture
AWS-Based Cloud Infrastructure
System Overview
This document describes the architecture of a modern Learning Management System (LMS) deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The system serves 50,000+ concurrent users across educational institutions, providing course management, content delivery, assessment, and analytics capabilities.
Core Application Components
The LMS is built using a microservice architecture, with each component designed for a specific function, allowing for independent scaling and deployment.

	Dependency and Risk Analysis
Dependency Relationships
Critical Dependency Chains:
1. User Access Flow: CloudFront $\to$ Load Balancer $\to$ API Gateway $\to$ Authentication Service $\to$ RDS
2. Content Delivery Flow: User Request $\to$ CloudFront $\to$ S3 $\to$ Content Service $\to$ RDS
3. Video Streaming Flow: User $\to$ CloudFront $\to$ S3 $\to$ Video Service $\to$ MediaConvert
4. Real-time Operations: WebSocket API $\to$ Cache (ElastiCache) $\to$ Application Services
Single Points of Failure (High Risk)
These components, if failed, could halt large segments or the entirety of the system.
* API Gateway: All services depend on it for routing.
* RDS Primary Database: Core data storage for most services.
* Authentication Service: Controls all system access.
* S3 Storage: Houses all course content and user uploads.
* Load Balancer (ALB): All incoming traffic routes through it.
Cascading Failure Scenarios
* If RDS fails $\to$ Authentication, User, Course, Content, Assignment services all fail.
* If API Gateway fails $\to$ All client-facing services become unreachable.
* If S3 fails $\to$ Content delivery, video streaming, and file access all fail.
* If ElastiCache fails $\to$ Session management breaks, performance degrades significantly.
AWS Outage Impact Analysis
December 2021 AWS US-EAST-1 Outage Scenario
During a regional outage, the following LMS impacts are anticipated or occurred:
* API Gateway (in affected region) becomes unavailable $\to$ All API requests fail.
* CloudFront experiences degraded performance $\to$ Content delivery slows (but often remains partially operational).
* RDS instances in affected AZs experience connection issues.
* Lambda functions fail to execute $\to$ Serverless components offline.
* S3 experiences elevated error rates $\to$ File access interrupted.
System Resilience Gaps
* Insufficient multi-region redundancy (over-reliance on a single AWS region, e.g., us-east-1).
* Lack of graceful degradation for non-critical features.
* No automatic failover for critical database operations (despite Multi-AZ, cross-region DR is missing).
* Limited offline capability for cached content.
